I want to make a a website for OMR checking, whose website will have the following:
1. First page will be input page where, Main Answer key and response sheets of students can be uploaded(max 30 response sheets).
2. As the images will be uploaded they will be sent to AI to process the response sheets of students and main answer key. 
3. AI will take the images and give the response of each images in JSON format.
4. After these things are done, the second page will load on which on left side the response sheet will be shown and on right side the extracted result from AI.
5. The response coming from AI and showing on right side of this page will be editable as response from AI may not be correct. 


- You may ask any questions before starting to build this.
- You have to build this step by step and after each step wait for my feedback and review.
- The color theme should be differnt from what is choose by AIs as I don't want to give this website a feel that it is built by AI.
- The website should sound professional 

Let's build this and then we will improve other things later.
